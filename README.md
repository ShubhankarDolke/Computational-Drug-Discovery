**üîç Computational Drug Discovery.**

In my computational drug discovery project, I employed a multi-faceted approach utilizing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning (ML), and predictive modeling to identify novel drugs for a specific disease. Inspired by a published paper [1] this project is a meticulous replication of the scientific process of drug discovery.
By leveraging data-driven insights, I delved into the intricacies of the disease, employing EDA to unravel patterns and correlations within relevant datasets. Subsequently, machine learning techniques were applied to construct predictive models, facilitating the identification of potential drug candidates.

This project not only showcases my technical prowess in the realms of data analysis and machine learning but also underscores my commitment to contributing to the scientific community. The replication of established scientific methodologies underscores my dedication to precision and thoroughness in the pursuit of groundbreaking solutions to real-world challenges.
