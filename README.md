# Computational Drug Discovery

In our Computational Drug Discovery project, we adopted a comprehensive approach that combined Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning (ML), and predictive modeling to identify potential new drugs for a specific disease. This project was inspired by a published paper [1], and we meticulously replicated the scientific process of drug discovery outlined in the study.

We began by leveraging data-driven insights to understand the complexities of the disease. Through EDA, we explored and analyzed various datasets, identifying patterns and correlations that provided valuable information. This initial step allowed us to uncover critical insights into the disease, which informed our next phase.

Next, we applied machine learning techniques to build predictive models. These models were crucial in identifying potential drug candidates by analyzing vast amounts of data and predicting which compounds might be effective against the disease. By doing so, we moved closer to discovering novel therapeutic solutions.
